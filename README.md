dp-search-api
==================

A ONS API used to search information against datasets which are published.

Requirements
-----------------
In order to run the service locally you will need the following:
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/index.html)

### Getting started

* Clone the repo `go get github.com/ONSdigital/dp-search-api`
* Run elasticsearch
* Run the application `make debug`

### Healthcheck

The endpoint `/healthcheck` checks the connection to elasticsearch and returns
one of:

- success (200, JSON "status": "OK")
- failure (500, JSON "status": "error").
