# dp-dimension-search-api

A ONS API used to search information against datasets which are published.

## Requirements

In order to run the service locally you will need the following:
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/index.html)

### Note
The only breaking change from verion 5.x to 6.x of elasticsearch is highlighting will
not work correctly but the api will stil be able to send back responses.

## Getting started

* Clone the repo `go get github.com/ONSdigital/dp-dimension-search-api`
* Run elasticsearch
* Run the application `make debug`

### Healthcheck

The endpoint `/health` checks all backing services, e.g. elasticsearch, dataset API:

- success (200)
- warning (429) - either application is starting up or a connection to a backend service 
    has been lost in the last `HEALTHCHECK_CRITICAL_TIMEOUT` value, (default set to 90 seconds, 
    see table below)but there is still time to recover.
- failure (500)


### Manually Creating and Deleting Indexes

CREATE: `curl -X PUT <HOSTNAME>/dimension-search/instances/<instanceID>/dimensions/<dimensionName> -H <AUTH HEADER>`
DELETE: `curl -X DELETE <HOSTNAME>/dimension-search/instances/<instanceID>/dimensions/<dimensionName> -H <AUTH HEADER>`

The `<AUTH HEADER>` must be either a valid `X-FLorence-Token` or a valid `Authorization` header.

### Kafka scripts
